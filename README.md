# FaceOff
FaceOff pits two players against eachother to see who can reflect an emotion best! 

The app will provide a random emotion that both players will portray. It then uses the facial recognition technology to determine who exhibited the emotion best!

## About
This is an Android and iOS app created using [Xamarin.Forms](https://www.xamarin.com/forms). The facial recognition uses [Microsoft's Coginitive Services Emotion API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/).
