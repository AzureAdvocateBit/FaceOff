# FaceOff
FaceOff pits two players against eachother to see who can reflect an emotion best! 

The app provides a random emotion that both players will portray. It then uses the facial recognition technology to determine who exhibited the emotion best!

## About
This is an Android, iOS and UWP app created using [Xamarin.Forms](https://www.xamarin.com/forms). The facial recognition uses [AWS Rekognition Service](https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/). 

## ToDo
To use AWS's Rekognition from this app, sign up for a [free AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com) and insert it to the code [here](./Source/FaceOff/Constants/AwsConstants.cs#L7).
